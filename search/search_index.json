Designed with a focus on development, it allows users to code the various components necessary to build their own desktop environment. This project is particularly useful for users of window managers such as Sway or Hyprland.</p> <p>Vixen Shell stands out by using Python for the back-end, while the user interface (front-end) is developed with modern web technologies such as React, TypeScript and CSS.</p> <p>The project was initially intended for Hyprland, but during its development, its flexibility has allowed it to be adapted to other window managers. This is why, as you will discover by reading this documentation, there are pre-existing features dedicated to Hyprland in Vixen Shell's extras and many references and examples related to Hyprland.</p> Prerequistes <p>Before getting started with Vixen Shell, make sure you have the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Operating System:</p> <ul> <li>A Linux distribution compatible with Wayland (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, Manjaro Linux).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Window Manager:</p> <ul> <li>Sway, Hyprland, or any other window manager compatible with Wayland.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Languages and Technologies:</p> <ul> <li>Python: Ensure Python is installed (version 3.11 or higher).</li> <li>yarn: For managing dependencies and building front-end components.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Development Tools:</p> <ul> <li>A code editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code is recommended).</li> <li>Git for version control (Recommended).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Permissions and Access:</p> <ul> <li>Administrator or superuser access to install certain dependencies and perform system configurations.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Version 1.0.0b1</p> <p>Currently, Vixen Shell is in Beta.

It provides a wide range of widgets and controls for developing modern applications with attractive and responsive interfaces. In Vixen Shell, GTK3 is primarily used for window management.</p> </li> <li> <p>WebKitGTK (or GTKWebKit2): WebKitGTK is a version of the WebKit rendering engine adapted for integration with GTK. WebKit is used by browsers like Safari. WebKitGTK allows embedding web content into GTK applications, offering capabilities for web navigation and HTML content display. Through WebKitGTK, Vixen Shell can display web content to generate user interfaces.</p> </li> <li> <p>GTK Layer Shell: GTK Layer Shell is a library enabling GTK applications to utilize the layer surfaces functionality of Wayland, a modern display server protocol for Linux.
