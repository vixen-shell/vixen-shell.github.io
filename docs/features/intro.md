## Introduction

Vixen Shell allows you to create your own user interfaces for your desktop environment. You can create integrated elements such as docks, panels, status bars, or even widgets, as well as windowed elements like menus, configuration spaces, or small utilities.

To generate these features, Vixen Shell requires two main types of support to create the configuration:

- A Python module will generate the root configuration for your feature and, if necessary, enrich the backend with customized data and actions.
- The user interface content coded in TypeScript using React. (optional, as a Vixen Shell feature does not necessarily require a user interface).
- If needed, a JSON file representing the user-side configuration.

!!! info
    These configuration files are automatically generated by the Vixen Shell manager's command line tool (vxm) when creating a new feature.

## Constituent Elements

`Feature`

:   To create these elements, Vixen Shell uses what we will refer to as "features."
    
    In Vixen Shell, a feature represents an extension (similar to Gnome Shell extensions) that contains all the code needed to make it work.

    A feature will contain a `Root Module` and a `User Configuration`. If the feature exposes a user interface, it will also include `Frames`, `Routes` and `State`.

`Root Module`
    
:   A root module involves implementing a Python module that defines the basic parameters and enriches the backend with specific data and actions.

`User Configuration`

:   The user configuration will take the form of a JSON file stored in the user's `$HOME` directory. This file will allow the modification and saving of certain feature parameters as needed.
    
    Additionally, the state of the feature, if applicable, will be stored in this same file.

`Frame`

:   A frame represents the visual spaces of the feature. It renders the user interface in the form of panels, bars, widgets, or windows, etc.

`Route`

:   A route allows frames to be directed to a specific path. A feature can contain multiple routes to display various user interface elements through the different frames that comprise it.

`State`

:   The state represents the application's state, capable of holding any type of data serializable in JSON format. It is shared and accessible across different routes.

    It also allows preserving the state of the feature after closing a session if necessary.
