Designed with a focus on development, it allows users to code the various components necessary to build their own desktop environment. This project is particularly useful for users of window managers such as Sway or Hyprland.</p> <p>Vixen Shell stands out by using Python for the back-end, while the user interface (front-end) is developed with modern web technologies such as React, TypeScript and CSS.</p> <p>The project was initially intended for Hyprland, but during its development, its flexibility has allowed it to be adapted to other window managers. This is why, as you will discover by reading this documentation, there are pre-existing features dedicated to Hyprland in Vixen Shell's extras and many references and examples related to Hyprland.</p>"},{"location":"#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>Before getting started with Vixen Shell, make sure you have the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Operating System:</p> <ul> <li>A Linux distribution compatible with Wayland (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, Manjaro Linux).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Window Manager:</p> <ul> <li>Sway, Hyprland, or any other window manager compatible with Wayland.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Languages and Technologies:</p> <ul> <li>Python: Ensure Python is installed (version 3.8 or higher).</li> <li>yarn: For managing dependencies and building front-end components.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Development Tools:</p> <ul> <li>A code editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code is recommended).</li> <li>Git for version control (Recommended).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Permissions and Access:</p> <ul> <li>Administrator or superuser access to install certain dependencies and perform system configurations.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"#yarn","title":"Yarn","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that Yarn is installed on your system.
